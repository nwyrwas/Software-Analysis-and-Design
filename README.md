# Software-Analysis-and-Design


Hello everyone,

The project that is uploaded to this repository, is a project pertaining to a DriverPass company. The company wanted to see how we would be able to assist them with creating a system that allows easier booking and tracking of driving lessons for the community. One document
That I think I could revise on would be the system design document. As there is always a more efficient and benenficial way to optimize some diagrams that I have outlined. To make it more sufficient for the company. I interpretted the user's needs into my system design
by displaying everything that they would need to access. Such as driving tests, a simple UI/UX that would make it easy to navigate. While also ensuring that they have a good understanding on who their instructor would be, and managing their accounts.

It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing as it helps build more perspective. As well as, it allows the design team to ensure that we are able to maintain the vision that the client and user would want. When it comes to approaching on designing a 
software, I like to look at all the requirements that a client may state. As well as break everything down, based on effort. To easily allow tasks to be delegated and managed during a sprint. Main techniques or strategies I love using when analyzing and designing a system
is having multiple scrum meetings. As it allows strong collaboration and communication to occur.
