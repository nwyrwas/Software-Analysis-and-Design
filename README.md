# Software Analysis and Design: DriverPass System

Hello everyone, my name is **Nick Wyrwas**, and I am part of the **CS-255-R4786** course.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project developed for **DriverPass**, a company aiming to simplify the booking and tracking of driving lessons for the community. The goal was to design a system that would allow users to book lessons, track their progress, and manage their accounts effectively, while also giving them insights into their instructors and upcoming driving tests.

## Key Features of the System:
- **User Interface (UI/UX)**: A simple, intuitive design that makes it easy for users to book lessons, view schedules, and understand their driving progress.
- **Instructor Management**: Provides users with the ability to view detailed information about their driving instructor and track their lessons.
- **Account Management**: Allows users to manage their profiles and keep track of their progress over time.
- **Driving Test Integration**: Integrates driving test bookings with lesson schedules, ensuring seamless coordination.

## Document Revisions:
One document I believe could be improved is the **system design document**. There is always room to optimize diagrams and make them more effective. I plan to revisit and improve these diagrams to make them more efficient and user-friendly, ensuring that the client gets the most value.

## Approach and User Needs Interpretation:
I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on the following:
- Ensuring the system provides easy access to essential features like booking driving tests and tracking lessons.
- Creating a simple UI/UX design to ensure that the system is easy to navigate.
- Ensuring that users have a clear understanding of their instructor, lesson progress, and account information.

I kept the user’s needs in mind while designing the system to ensure that the design remained aligned with both client expectations and the end-user experience. 

## Design Methodology:
To approach the software design, I took the following steps:
1. **Requirements Gathering**: I carefully reviewed all of the client's requirements to ensure that the system would meet the needs of both the company and its users.
2. **Breaking Down Tasks**: I broke down the tasks based on their effort level to ensure that development could be done effectively and efficiently.
3. **Scrum Meetings**: I heavily relied on **scrum meetings** to foster collaboration and communication within the team. These meetings allowed for quick problem-solving and helped us stay on track with our progress.

### Why User Needs Are Critical:
Considering the user’s needs is vital in designing software, as it ensures that the system will meet the expectations of both the client and end users. It also keeps the design aligned with the vision of the project, which is key to ensuring the software’s success.

## Future Improvements:
- **Optimizing System Design**: Revisiting the system design document to refine and enhance the user interface, functionality, and overall architecture.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Continuing to iterate on the user interface based on user feedback and further usability testing.
